# Marketing Analytics Project: A/B Testing for Hot Sales Display Optimization  

## Problem Definition  

### The Problem Area  
**A/B Testing** â€“ Optimizing the online display of promotional content to improve customer engagement and sales in the e-commerce grocery and retail sector.  

### Defining the Specific Problem  
Supermarkets lack data-driven guidelines on the optimal sequence to display "Hot Sales" items on their website homepage. The absence of an optimized ordering may result in:  
- Lower click-through rates (CTR)  
- Missed sales opportunities  
- Suboptimal customer engagement  

## Proposed Solution & Methodology  

### Data Collection  
- Conduct a **controlled A/B test** with two or more homepage versions, each displaying "Hot Sales" products in a different order.  
- Track user interactions (clicks, time spent, conversions) and store data in a structured database.  



## Expected Outcomes  
- **Higher CTR** on "Hot Sales" items.  
- **Increased revenue** from optimized product placement.  
- **Data-backed guidelines** for future promotional layouts.
