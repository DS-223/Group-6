Thompson Sampling algorithm to recommend supermarket products. It first looks for an existing project in the database; if none is found, it creates one. Then it checks for associated products (bandits). If none exist, it adds new ones with random alpha and beta values, which are used in the Beta distribution to calculate selection probabilities. The get_page_recommendations() function ranks products by sampling from their distributions and shows the top ones per page. Simulated clicks update each productâ€™s success or failure, helping the model learn over time which products perform better.
